                <p>
                It‚Äôs been about a month here living here in Leuven, Belgium! The time has flown and so much has happened since I first moved here! I‚Äôll try my best to document everything that I have experienced so far!
                </p>
                <h2>Chapter 1: The Long Journey</h2>
                <p>
                Traveling to Belgium was simple at first! My flight from Dallas arrived on time in Chicago and the international flight was on time! Easy. Also, the international flight didn‚Äôt feel that long (I had prepared beforehand with downloading a lot of movies/shows from Netflix)! After the 9ish hour flight, I had arrived at the Brussels Airport (just outside of Brussels). The first thing I needed to figure out was if I needed to get tested for coronavirus or not, which I found out from a staff member was not needed since I had received a negative test within 72 hours before my flight (yay!). The second and third things I needed to figure out, was 2) which train I should take to get Leuven and 3) how I was going to lug my luggage all the way to my apartment??? Thankfully I just had my exactly 50 lb. checked bag and my duffel (don‚Äôt forget the backpack as well). So, with that I headed to the train station, which was adjacent to the airport (nice!). I found out which train to take thanks to Google Maps (which has come in very handy this whole month!) and I somehow managed to get on board (it was at this moment I realized that I should have been working out this Summer). The most awkward part of this train ride was me 1) not being able to lift my bag up to the racks (not going to accidentally kill someone with falling, 50 lb. luggage) and 2) not being picking a row of seats wide enough to fit my luggage in. So here I am trying to shove my luggage in a tiny side seat, while others are trying to get by. Eventually I give up, because I‚Äôm too tired and accept my fate. The others do as well and just lift their luggage over mine. So sorry üò≠! But after everyone had passed I managed to drag my luggage in a little further to get it out of the aisle (phew). Next step: when do I get off of this train? Thankfully the train conductor that checks everyone‚Äôs tickets was able to tell me that it was the next stop (great!). So I get off the train at the stop with all of my stuff and then realize that the escalator that goes down (de-escalator?) was out of order‚Ä¶üò±‚Ä¶so I have to lug my stuff down stairs. I was already tired and now I‚Äôm reaching a limit wow. Next step: ride the bus to my apartment. Okay, here we go, using Google maps I found which bus to take to get to my apartment and thanks to some prior research I knew how to buy a bus ticket online (easy). So now I get on the bus with my stuff and I take a celebratory selfie! Now when to get off? There‚Äôs no train conductor this time, so I‚Äôm anxiously checking Google maps to see where my stop might be. More stops come and more people get on, but not too many thankfully. Finally, my stop is in sight, so I hit the blue ‚Äòstop‚Äô button. And begin to head towards the door, but the door isn‚Äôt opening. I‚Äôm a little confused and look around, but thankfully a kind Flemish man pressed the ‚Äòopen‚Äô button for the door and I leaped out saying ‚ÄòDankuvel!‚Äô (thanks a lot!) on my way out. Wow. The end of my long journey was in sight. After a few more minutes of dragging my luggage to my apartment I found the landlord and he showed me to my room and with that my first journey was over. Praise God!

                <h2>Chapter 2: UCI Road World Cycling Championships</h2>
                <p>
                What have I been up to since then? Well, I‚Äôve been working on a lot of logistical things here in Belgium with regards to me being a PhD student at KU Leuven and also my residence here in Belgium (boring stuff). The more exciting thing was during this time, Leuven was preparing for the UCI Road World Cycling Championships. The races for both the women and the men ended in Leuven, so there were a lot of people coming from around Europe to watch! Thankfully, I came at the right time and was able to see parts of these races! My strategy consisted of arriving at the section of the course near me and from there walk to the city center (near the university library) to see the announcement of the top 3! This strategy worked for both the women‚Äôs and the men‚Äôs races (I don‚Äôt know if it was the best, but it worked for me!). This race definitely made me more inspired to cycle around Leuven (although to be honest I have not yet worked up the courage to do so)! However, I plan on getting a bike soon ü§ûüèª.

                <h2>Chapter 3: What I am doing now?</h2>
                <p>
                Now that I‚Äôve had a month to get used to Leuven, I feel pretty confident walking around the streets and exploring the city. Overall, the city is very safe and it is also very clean! I have almost unlocked access to all the city has to offer with the exception of a Belgian bank and bankcard, which if you do not have prevents you from shopping/eating at some places since they require contactless payments. But I‚Äôm very close to getting one, so I‚Äôm excited üòÜ. Also, I have met a lot of good friends from my lab that I am researching at. I am also part of a little band that consists of some of my lab members. I recently purchased an electric guitar (which is a story in of itself) so I‚Äôm playing that in the band (very fun)! Another thing is finding a church here in Leuven, but I‚Äôm still working on that. Over the next few months I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get more stories, so stay tuned! Also, if you have any questions about living in Belgium feel free to reach out to me via Facebook messenger (since I expect most people reading this will be coming from my facebook).
