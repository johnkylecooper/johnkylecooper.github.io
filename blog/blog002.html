                <h1>October / November</h1>
                <div>
                Sorry üòÖ, I haven‚Äôt had much time to sit down and write about my time here in Leuven! So I‚Äôll try my best to summarize
                my experiences during the months of October and November!
                <h2>KU Leuven 5 km Walk</h2>
                I was able to walk with colleagues from my lab through the beautiful campus of Arenberg! The walk was so nice and
                peaceful (I now often walk around this area during breaks, since I live so close).
                Plant Expo and KNAL Festival
                I purchased Sam the Sanseveria at the plant expo! After the plant expo, we went to one of the first events of the KNAL
                festival at Park Abbey (or Abdij van Park).
                <h2>Fiets Beginnen!</h2>
                One night I was walking back to my apartment when I ran into one of my lab colleagues, who noticed that I was
                ‚Äúbikeless‚Äù, so she offered me her old university bike. That next day I picked up the bike and was on my way! This bike
                has taken me so many places I probably would not have gone to had I not had the bike! Fiets aan!
                <h2>Friends from all over</h2>
                I‚Äôve been very lucky to meet such great people from my lab. They‚Äôve invited to many events and I‚Äôve been to meet so many
                people through them! From Italian and Colombian food in Leuven to Lebanese food in Brussels, I‚Äôve eaten and meeten (idk,
                whatever) so many awesome people! Leuven and Brussels are very international, so I‚Äôve met people from Belgium
                (obviously), the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Colombia, China, Taiwan, Lebanon, Tibet, and the list goes
                on!
