                    <h1>October and November</h1>
                    <div>
                        Sorry üòÖ, I haven‚Äôt had much time to sit down and write about my time here in Leuven! So I‚Äôll
                        try my best to summarize my experiences during the months of October and November!
                    </div>
                        <h2>KU Leuven 5 km Walk</h2>
                    <div>
                        I was able to walk with colleagues from my lab through the beautiful campus of Arenberg! The
                        walk was so nice and peaceful (I now often walk around this area during breaks, since I live so
                        close).
                    </div>
                    <h2>Plant Expo and KNAL Festival</h2>
                    <div>
                        I purchased Sam the Sanseveria at the plant expo! After the plant expo, we went to one of the
                        first events of the KNAL festival at Park Abbey (or Abdij van Park).
                    </div>
                    <h2>Fiets Beginnen!</h2>
                    <div>
                        One night I was walking back to my apartment when I ran into one of my lab colleagues, who
                        noticed that I was ‚Äúbikeless‚Äù, so she offered me her old university bike. That next day I picked
                        up the bike and was on my way! This bike has taken me so many places I probably would not have
                        gone to had I not had the bike! Fiets aan!
                    </div>
                        <h2>Friends from all over</h2>
                    <div>
                        I‚Äôve been very lucky (it's a God thing) to meet such great people from my lab. They‚Äôve invited to many events and
                        I‚Äôve been to meet so many people through them! From Italian and Colombian food in Leuven to
                        Lebanese food in Brussels, I‚Äôve eaten delicious food and have met so many awesome people! Leuven
                        and Brussels are very international, so I‚Äôve met people from Belgium (obviously), the
                        Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Colombia, China, Taiwan, Lebanon, Tibet, and the list
                        goes on!
