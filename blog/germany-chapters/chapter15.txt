Belgium! Home to Mussels, Frites, Waffles! Out of all the side-trips I participated in, this one would have to be my favorite. I had a lot of fun with these people that I traveled with and being in Belgium made it even better! Our trip consisted of two days in Brussels and two days in Bruges. Both cities were equally fun, but in their own special way, which was awesome! Some highlights: the Manneken Piss (Brussels), Delirium (a bar that serves 300 different types of beer [listed in the Guinness Book Of World Records]) (Brussels), the Belfry Tower (Bruges), Night Bike Ride through the city (Bruges). Overall, I would have to put Belgium on my list of top countries in Europe, because of the friendly people, beautiful landscape, and great food.
