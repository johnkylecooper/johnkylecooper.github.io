Okay so after Week 2 with the Cologne Excursion, our group needed to study for our 211 Exam that was next Monday (The Day Before We Left For The Vienna Excursion). That Saturday, Kendrick Lim, Amran Kang, and I took a study break and sat down at a Café. While at the Café, we met an older woman, who had lived in Bonn, Germany for most of her life and was interested in talking to Americans in order to learn more and work on her English. We had an hour long conversation about many topics: from politics to English accents around America. We considered it a conversation to remember, because it allowed us to see perspectives of America that we would never normally be able to hear about.

Skip ahead a couple days to Tuesday morning…\\
Kendrick and I wake up at 4:40 AM to realize that we had missed our 4:20 AM cab…
Luckily our great friend Cerci Hammons was able to get the cab driver to turn around and pick us up in time to arrive at the bus departing for the Airport.
Thankful for surviving the morning, we flew out of the Bonn/Köln Airport on our way to Vienna.

\subsubsection{Quick Summary of Vienna}
Honestly, I loved Vienna — It was very interesting to see a city so different to anything I have ever seen. The city is always so bright — no matter what time of day/night it is. The city also has such a rich history, which we learned mostly from our (rite of passage) Vienna Walking Tour, given to us by Dr. Wasser (So Glad I purchased a 3 Euro scarf before we embarked on that tour. I was able to try out some of Vienna’s delicious schnitzel and I was able to try out a famous cake that is popular in Vienna (made for the King back in the day!)
In our free-time we were able to visit the Cisi Museum, which was filled with plates (at first), then we got to the actual museum. We also had the opportunity to visit the Fine Arts Museum (Which has amazing Egyptian and Greek Artifacts) and the Natural History Museum, which had an amazing Rock and Gem Collection (Wish my Father could have been there!)
