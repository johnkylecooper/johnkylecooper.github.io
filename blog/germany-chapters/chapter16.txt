I know what you're thinking. What the heck were they thinking? Well, if you look at these amazing photos, you might change your mind. Budapest was a great final trip. The city is has a lot to offer: great, cheap food; bath-houses; night-life, and caves! However, one thing that all of Hungary must comply with is the Forint (this little [or should I say large] currency will throw off your mindset of spending. To place it in perspective 1000 Forints is about 3 Euros (What the heck?!). But wait! Due to the Forint being so small compared to the Euro, items in Budapest are a lot cheaper than they  normally are in Europe! For example, a good meal (see the goulash meal in the pictures below) is worth around 10 Euro (Click* Noice!). So, if you want to find out more take a look through the pictures!
