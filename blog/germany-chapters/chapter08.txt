Karneval Was An Amazing Experience That I Will Never Forget! Yes, you could say, "It's just like Mardi Gras, but in Germany, right?"; however, I would just whisper in your ear, "KÃ¶ln Alaaf". No one will understand the greatness of Karneval until they experience it themselves. There is so much work and time that goes into preparing for 5 days! Tons of candy (like literally tons) and numbers of floats is just one of the end products pumped out by the time Karneval begins. During these days I was able to meet so many German people and learn more about the culture surrounding this holiday.
