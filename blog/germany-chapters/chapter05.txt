\subsubsection{Weekend In Prague}
After a whole week in Vienna I thought it would be difficult to find a city that would supersede my previous experiences, but Prague, Czech Republic was absolutely my favorite city so far on this entire study-abroad experience. The city as a whole is highly populated by tourists during the day, which to a normal traveler would bring down the experience; however, our group was smart and was able to do some research prior to visiting and it made the experience in Prague 10x more enjoyable. Our research led us to amazing places such as: Nase Maso ( a small burger place on D’louha street, that makes the most tasty burgers and meats in Prague!), the Petrin Tower (a smaller version of Paris’ Eiffel Tower … the tower overlooks Prague and gives you a spectacular view [It is quite a hike though]), and lastly Skautsky Institut (A small Café hidden to the side of Old Town —  it is home to many locals and to the Scout group in Prague, which was awesome for me being an Eagle Scout [I was able to talk to some of the scouts there and learn there handshake], I will never forget the looks on the locals’ faces when they saw a group of Americans enter into their café [they were surprised we had found their hidden place.) Overall, Prague may have felt like  a large tourist city (as a whole), but if you do some research it can feel like a wonderful town filled with Bohemian locality that makes the trip much more special.
