Big Event Weekend was a grat tim (great time)! It was so amazing to have the opportunity to participate in the International Big Event! Not many people can say they have done this. I enjoyed our time volunteering and being able to interact with the students from the other programs! Our group was able to help fix and replant a garden in the back of a nursing home. I was very glad that we were able to serve this facility because they were some of the nicest Germans I have ever met! 
All in all Big Event was a Big Success.
