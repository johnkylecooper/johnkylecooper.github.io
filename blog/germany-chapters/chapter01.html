                    Howdy,

                    My name is John Kyle Cooper and I am a Sophomore Biomedical Engineering Student from Waco, Texas,
                    but
                    most importantly I am THE Loudest and THE PROUDEST Fightin' Texas Aggie Member of The Class Of 2019!
                    A-A-A-A-A!

                    Tonight is the last night that I will spend in Waco, Texas for the next four months. I am amazed and
                    excited knowing that tomorrow I will board a Lufthansa flight and depart for Bonn, Germany! Ever
                    since I
                    first traveled with my family to London, England in 7th grade, I have been inspired to travel the
                    world
                    and gain a better understanding/perspective in a world full of different viewpoints. As a Biomedical
                    Engineer, I believe perspective is an important characteristic to hold when developing medical
                    devices
                    (a great engineer sees the need for a device). I am looking forward to learning more about my field
                    this
                    semester. Dr. Wasser has commonly called this study abroad trip a "journey" and it rightfully is
                    one,
                    because this trip signifies a time, where I will be the most independent I have ever been in my
                    entire
                    life (this excites me, but terrifies me at the same time)! Nevertheless, I am very ready to take on
                    this
                    semester with a strong spirit for adventure!

                    One thing that I (at the end of this "journey") hope to see is growth. My goal is (on May 3) to look
                    back at this post and know that I am not the same person writing this post.
                    (Hopefully my writing skills will have improved as well!)

                    Thanks and Gig'em,
                    John Kyle Cooper
