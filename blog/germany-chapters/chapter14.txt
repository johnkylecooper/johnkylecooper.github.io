Amsterdam was a truly unique experience. The town has two sides to it one that is the historical  part town that has existed since the 12th century, then there is the post-70's Amsterdam with the Red Light District and the various coffee-shops. I prefer the historical part of Amsterdam and I feel that the post-70's Amsterdam, that comes out at night kind of throws off the old Amsterdam vibe. However, both are very unique and should be experienced (not fully [obviously], but should be seen). Furthermore, we were able to visit both the Van Gogh Museum and the Anne Frank House. The Van Gogh Museum was very special and inspiring. As someone that has delved into art through sketching, painting, and more modern forms of artistry I found the life and works of Van Gogh inspirational. Next, we schlepped on over to the Anne Frank House. The Anne Frank House is something that needs to be visited by everyone, not only because you can say you've been there, but due to the fact that this house and the history that it holds will invoke feelings inside you that you didn't know were there. The girl, Anne Frank, will change you from when you enter that house and to the point you leave it. History needs to be understood. One must see the world and its history in order to understand it.
