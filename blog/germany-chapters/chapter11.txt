Spring Break Was Amazing. It was one of the lose experience that I will never forget. Our group traveled from France, to Ireland, to Portugal, to Spain, and finally back to Germany all in one week! Dr. Wasser was correct when he warned us that more than one country for Spring Break was too much to handle (we really tested that theory). But I believe that our group traveled these the major cities in these countries well. We were able to see Dublin and the Cliffs Of Moher in Ireland, Lisbon and Sintra in Portugal, and Barcelona and Monserrat in Spain. The greatest thing to experience was one day you heard English and the next you heard Portuguese (a completely different language). This is the beauty of Europe and it is one of the reasons I will love and cherish this area of the world so much. There is so much culture, so many people, and so many stories that make up the history of our world. People need to travel, otherwise these stories will never be heard and they will be forgotten in the abyss of the future.
