The Paris Excursion was by far my most favorite excursion of the entire study abroad program. It was my favorite because: we really were able to not just "see" France, but experience the country. Unlike, my other trips during the semester, where I have just been able to see the country and never really had the opportunity dive into its culture and history. Julien was my honestly favorite part of the trip. He MADE my trip, because he helped the group experience French culture through his various stories, the places he brought us to, and the foods he had us try. The picnic in Versailles was also one of the highlights of the excursion. A food experience I will never forget!
