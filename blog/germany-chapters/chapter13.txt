During the week, I had the opportunity to shadow an anesthesiologist at the Uniklinikum. I was able to sit in on four surgeries, three in Eurology and one in general surgery. It was truly a unique experience that helped me gain a better perspective of the medical field. I also was able to meet and converse with many students and doctors from the Uniklinikum! Next on Friday, we had the opportunity to go on a tour of an extensive Anesthesiology Museum led by the owner Dr. Stökel an esteemed anesthesiologist! That evening, I was able to meet up with my cousin, Christina, from New York! I was so excited to see her and show her around Bonn! I was able to show her many of Bonn's highlights and we even ran into a concert in Münsterplatz! It was a great night! Unfortunately, she had to leave the next morning for Slovakia. Finally on Sunday, I was able to participate in the Bonn Marathon! What a day! I was very nervous going into the race (which involved me running ~7 miles, "This Doesn't Sound Like A Lot But I'm Not A Runner So..."), but I'm very glad I signed up. I was able to support a charity by running as well! My favorite part of the race was the end (of course), because I knew I had made it and because at the end I sprinted (as light as a feather) to the finish line.
