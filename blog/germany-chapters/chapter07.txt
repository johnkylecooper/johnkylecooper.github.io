The first major place we visited was the Bayer AG Center. It was a quaint place in Leverkusen, but had a lot to offer! The tour guide was very nice and very funny as well. My favorite memory here was seeing James try on the geriatric suit in one of the "testing rooms". In the backyard of the Bayer AG Center is a beautiful garden that used to be privately owned. It was a beautiful garden and would love to go back to Leverkusen someday just to visit it! Next, for the weekend we traveled to Munich, home to the famous Oktoberfest and also for their various Beerhalls (one of the most famous being the "Hofbrauhaus". I loved Munich, because (although the city is a little large) it definitely is clean and very walkable. However, our travels did not stop just at Munich that weekend, we also made a trip up to the Neuschwanstein Castle, which is located in one of the most beautiful areas you will ever witness in your life (biased I know)! Overall, the trip to Munich will not be forgotten.
