Berlin! The hippest and most "edgy" city in all of Germany! The city has to be one of my favorites. The city has a rich history, before the wars and after (it definitely has quite a history during WWII) and in the late 80's with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Besides this the city also is super cool with all of the qualities that a big city possesses! I had the best DÃ¶ner in Berlin at Mustafa's Kebap (Lecker!) and  unfortunately even though currywurst originates from Berlin, the Curry 36 proved to be "good" but not "lecker". Highlights Of The Trip Include: A Giant Hauptbahnhof, The Reichstag and The Bundestadt, The Brandenburg Gate, The Memorial For The Murdered Jews Of Europe, Checkpoint Charlie, Sections Of The Berlin Wall and The East Side Gallery, The Berlin TV Tower, The Pergamum Museum, and The Berlin Cathedral.

Overall: Ich bin eine Berliner! - John F. Kennedy
